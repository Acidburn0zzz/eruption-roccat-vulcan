# Eruption Lua Support Library

_This document is a work-in-progress draft_

## Overview

Eruption provides a small, but hopefully useful library of functions that are
intended to be used by Lua scripts. Functions can be provided either by the
daemon proper, or by plugins. Plugin specific functions are only available
if the respective plugin is loaded.

## Available Plugins

* Keyboard: Process keyboard events, like e.g. "Key pressed"
* System: Basic system information and status, like e.g. running processes
* Sensors: Query system sensor values, like e.g. CPU package temperature
* Audio: Audio related tasks, like playing sounds
* Introspection: Provides internal status information of the Eruption daemon
* Profiles: Switch profiles based on system state

## Available Functions

Eruption currently ships with the following library functions:

_Non-exhaustive, more documentation coming soon_

Please Note:
* All color values should lie in the range [0..255] unless otherwise specified
* Some API calls currently involve bringing up of threads for each call,
	especially the `System` and `Sensor` ones, so better don't call them in a
	tight loop

## Available Callback Functions (Events)

Eruption currently calls the following event handler functions, if they are present in a Lua script:

| Name        | Plugin  | Parameters | Description                   |
| ----------- | ------- | ------     | ----------------------------- |
| `on_startup`  | _core_  | _n/a_    | Sent on startup, e.g. when a script is loaded |

Exhaustive listing of all currently available event callbacks

## Example Code

The following code will change a key's color to `bright red` after it has been
pressed.

#### Listing 01
```lua

-- global array that stores each key's current color
color_map = {}

function on_startup()
    -- turn off all key LEDs
    for i = 0, get_num_keys() do
        color_map[i] = rgba_to_color(0, 0, 0, 0)
    end

    -- update keyboard LED state
    submit_color_map(color_map)
end

function on_key_down(key_index)
    info("Pressed key: " .. key_index)

    -- set color of pressed key to red
    color_map[key_index] = rgb_to_color(255, 0, 0, 255)
    submit_color_map(color_map)
end
```
