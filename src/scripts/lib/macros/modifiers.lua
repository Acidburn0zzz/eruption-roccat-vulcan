ENABLE_EASY_SHIFT = true   -- set this to false if you don't want to
						   -- sacrifice the Caps Lock functionality


-- comment out the declarations below to change the modifier key you want to use; default is the "Right Menu" key:

MODIFIER_KEY = RIGHT_MENU   -- this is just a hack, it is needed until we support the FN key
MODIFIER_KEY_INDEX   = 84   -- the KEY_INDEX of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above
MODIFIER_KEY_EV_CODE = 127  -- the EV_KEY code of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above


-- or use this if you prefer "Right Alt" as the modifier key:

-- MODIFIER_KEY = RIGHT_ALT	   -- this is just a hack, it is needed until we support the FN key
-- MODIFIER_KEY_INDEX   = 71   -- the KEY_INDEX of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above
-- MODIFIER_KEY_EV_CODE = 100  -- the EV_KEY code of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above


-- or use this if you prefer "Right Shift" as the modifier key:

-- MODIFIER_KEY = RIGHT_SHIFT  -- this is just a hack, it is needed until we support the FN key
-- MODIFIER_KEY_INDEX   = 83   -- the KEY_INDEX of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above
-- MODIFIER_KEY_EV_CODE = 54   -- the EV_KEY code of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above


-- or use this if you prefer "Right Ctrl" as the modifier key:

-- MODIFIER_KEY = RIGHT_CTRL   -- this is just a hack, it is needed until we support the FN key
-- MODIFIER_KEY_INDEX   = 90   -- the KEY_INDEX of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above
-- MODIFIER_KEY_EV_CODE = 97   -- the EV_KEY code of the modifier key; has to match the key defined above
